This repo contains my code for the semester-long maze game project for the Software Development course at William & Mary. The project was completed in Fall 2021.

My implementations were written on top of provided skeleton code for a Java application, which was then ported to/adjusted to work on Android. I was primarily responsible for implementing the Boruvka maze generation algorithm, the solvers (robots + sensors), and the Android app UI.
